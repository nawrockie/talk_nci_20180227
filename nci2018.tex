\item Originally discovered in 1981 in complex with Ro60 protein, a target of 
  autoimmune antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
  and Sjogren's synodrome\footnote{Mol Cell Biol. 1981 Dec; 1(12): 1138–1149.}. 
\item Four distinct Y RNAs are encoded in the human genome
%\item Ro60 homologs are encoded in most animal genomes and about 5\% of
%  bacteria

\textbf{Attempting to start a collaboration with the Wolin lab: \\ Can

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Downloaded UniProt's collection of \emph{reference proteomes}
  and associated genomes.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{8586 bacteria}
    \item 5152 viruses
    \item 465 archaea
    \item 1064 Eukaryota
\end{itemize}
\item[2.] Searched bacterial proteomes for TROVE (Ro and Rsr have this
  domain) and PNPase domains using HMMER and Pfam. 
\item[3.] Searched bacterial genomes with current Rfam YrlA model 
  (RF02553) using Infernal and Rfam.
